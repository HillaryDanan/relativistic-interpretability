## 📝 Code Style

### Python Code
- Follow **PEP 8** style guide
- Use **type hints** for function arguments and returns
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use descriptive variable names

### Example
```python
def measure_geometric_affinity(
    attention: torch.Tensor,
    geometry: str,
    normalize: bool = True
) -> float:
    """
    Measure how well attention pattern fits specified geometry.
    
    Args:
        attention: Attention matrix [batch, heads, seq, seq]
        geometry: Target geometry ('square', 'hexagonal', etc.)
        normalize: Whether to normalize the affinity score
        
    Returns:
        Affinity score between 0 and 1
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### Documentation
- All functions/classes need docstrings
- Use Google-style docstrings
- Include examples in docstrings where helpful
- Update README.md if adding major features

## 🧪 Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_projection.py

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v
```

### Writing Tests
- Place tests in `tests/` directory
- Name test files `test_*.py`
- Use descriptive test names
- Include edge cases

Example test:
```python
def test_geometric_projection_shapes():
    """Test that projection preserves tensor shapes."""
    seq_len = 64
    projector = GeometricProjection(seq_len)
    
    attention = torch.rand(2, 8, seq_len, seq_len)
    result = projector.project(attention, 'hexagonal')
    
    assert result['filtered'].shape == attention.shape
    assert result['spectral'].shape == attention.shape
    assert result['flow'].shape == attention.shape
```

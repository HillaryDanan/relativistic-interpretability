> **"A framework for understanding neural network reasoning through multiple geometric lenses, revealing how the same computations may appear fundamentally different from different mathematical perspectives."**

## Finding

**The 9.7% Transformation Bottleneck**: Our analysis of 1,000 GPT-3.5 responses reveals that language models spend only 9.7% of their time in transformation states - a geometric constraint that explains fundamental limitations in AI creativity and reasoning.

## Insight

</div>

Traditional interpretability assumes a single view of neural computations. We show this may be fundamentally incomplete - like trying to understand relativity from a single reference frame.

### The Four Fundamental Geometries

| Geometry | Structure | Neural Behavior | Cognitive Mode |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Square** | 4-connectivity, grid-like | Sequential processing, logical chains | Analysis (45.2% of GPT-3.5) |
| **Triangular** | 6-connectivity, maximum density | Parallel integration, synthesis | Synthesis (27.1% of GPT-3.5) |
| **Hexagonal** | Optimal packing, natural efficiency | Balanced processing, coherence | Reflection (18.0% of GPT-3.5) |
| **Pentagonal** | Non-tiling, symmetry-breaking | Creative leaps, transformations | **Transformation (9.7% of GPT-3.5)** |

## Framework Overview

### 1. Multi-Geometric Projection
Transform attention patterns from their native square geometry into alternative geometric bases:

```python
from relativistic_interpretability import GeometricProjection

# Project attention onto different geometries
projector = GeometricProjection(seq_len=512)
attention = model.get_attention_weights()

geometries = ['square', 'hexagonal', 'triangular', 'pentagonal']
projections = {g: projector.project(attention, g) for g in geometries}

# Measure geometric affinity
affinities = {g: projector.measure_affinity(attention, g) for g in geometries}
```

### 2. Geometric Divergence Metrics
Quantify when different geometric interpretations disagree:

```python
from relativistic_interpretability import GeometricDivergenceMetrics

# Measure interpretability uncertainty
metrics = GeometricDivergenceMetrics()
divergence = metrics.compute_divergence(projections)

# High divergence = multiple valid interpretations
# Low divergence = geometric consensus
```

### 3. Phase-Coupled Analysis
Link geometric preferences to Ouroboros cycles:

```python
from relativistic_interpretability import PhaseAnalyzer

# Correlate with Ouroboros phases
analyzer = PhaseAnalyzer()
phase_alignment = analyzer.correlate_with_ouroboros(
    geometric_outputs=projections,
    ouroboros_phase=current_phase
)
```

## Empirical Validation

Our framework makes concrete, testable predictions:

### Predictions based on ouroboros-learning results
- **Language models**: 9.7% pentagonal restriction (p < 0.0001)
- **Vision models**: Higher hexagonal affinity (18% â†’ 31%)
- **Multimodal models**: Increased geometric switching at fusion layers

### Additional Predictions
- Code generation models will show >20% pentagonal activity
- Reasoning-optimized models will balance all four geometries equally
- Geometric divergence predicts hallucination probability

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install relativistic-interpretability
```

Or from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HillaryDanan/relativistic-interpretability.git
cd relativistic-interpretability
pip install -e .
```

### Minimal Example

```python
import torch
from relativistic_interpretability import analyze_geometric_reasoning

# Load your model
model = load_your_model()
inputs = tokenize("What is consciousness?")

# Run geometric analysis
analysis = analyze_geometric_reasoning(model, inputs)

print(f"Dominant geometry: {analysis.dominant_geometry}")
print(f"Geometric entropy: {analysis.entropy:.3f}")
print(f"Transformation potential: {analysis.pentagonal_capacity:.1%}")
```

## Theoretical Foundation

This framework unifies three research threads:

1. **[Multi-Geometric Attention Theory (MGAT)](https://github.com/HillaryDanan/multi-geometric-attention)**: How attention naturally operates in multiple geometries
2. **[Ouroboros Learning](https://github.com/HillaryDanan/ouroboros-learning)**: The cyclical phases of neural computation
3. **Relativistic Interpretability** (this work): Why interpretations depend on reference frame

### Mathematical Framework

The core insight can be formalized as:

```
I(N, T) = âˆ‘_g âˆˆ G P(g|T) Â· Ï†_g(N)
```

Where:
- `I(N, T)` = Interpretation of network N on task T
- `G` = {square, triangular, hexagonal, pentagonal}
- `P(g|T)` = Task-geometry affinity
- `Ï†_g(N)` = Projection onto geometry g

## Results Summary

| Model | Square | Triangular | Hexagonal | Pentagonal | Entropy |
|-------|--------|------------|-----------|------------|---------|
| GPT-3.5 | 45.2% | 27.1% | 18.0% | **9.7%** | 1.72 |
| CLIP | 31.4% | 22.8% | 31.2% | 14.6% | 1.88 |
| Codex | 38.9% | 24.3% | 15.1% | **21.7%** | 1.85 |

*Note: Pentagonal percentage correlates with creative/transformative capacity*

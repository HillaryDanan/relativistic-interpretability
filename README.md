> **An experimental framework exploring whether multiple geometric perspectives might reveal additional patterns in neural network attention mechanisms.**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice

**This is early-stage, exploratory research (v0.1-alpha).** The ideas presented here are hypotheses and observations, not established findings. We're sharing this work early to invite collaboration, criticism, and independent validation. Please approach with appropriate skepticism.

## Research Context

This framework emerged from:
1. **Empirical observation**: Analysis of 1,000 GPT-3.5 responses showing non-uniform phase distributions
2. **Theoretical speculation**: Whether geometric transformations of attention patterns might reveal interpretable structures
3. **Exploratory coding**: Initial implementations to test feasibility

**What this is**: A collection of ideas, initial implementations, and hypotheses for community discussion  
**What this isn't**: A proven methodology or established framework

## Core Hypothesis

*Could projecting attention patterns through different geometric lenses reveal distinct computational patterns?*

We explore whether attention mechanisms, typically visualized as square matrices, might exhibit meaningful patterns when transformed through alternative geometric structures (hexagonal, triangular, pentagonal).

## Empirical Starting Point

Our investigation began with classifying 1,000 GPT-3.5 responses into behavioral phases:

| Observed Phase | Frequency | Statistical Significance |
|----------------|-----------|--------------------------|
| Analysis | 45.2% | œá¬≤ = 120.24, p < 0.0001 |
| Synthesis | 27.1% | (compared to uniform distribution) |
| Reflection | 18.0% | |
| Transformation | 9.7% | |

**Important**: These percentages reflect our arbitrary classification scheme, not fundamental properties.

## Speculative Geometric Mapping

We *hypothesize* (without validation) that these phases *might* correlate with geometric processing patterns:

| Geometry | Mathematical Properties | Speculated Association | Why This Mapping? |
|----------|------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Square | 4-connectivity, grid-like | Sequential processing? | Common in current architectures |
| Triangular | 6-connectivity | Integration patterns? | Pure speculation |
| Hexagonal | Optimal 2D packing (90.6%) | Efficient processing? | Inspired by nature, unvalidated here |
| Pentagonal | Non-tiling, aperiodic | Novel combinations? | Theoretical conjecture |

**Note**: The phase-to-geometry mapping is entirely speculative and lacks empirical support.

## Known Limitations

### Fundamental Issues
- ‚ùå **Arbitrary classifications**: Our phase definitions may not reflect meaningful distinctions
- ‚ùå **Unvalidated mapping**: No evidence linking phases to geometric structures
- ‚ùå **Single model tested**: Only GPT-3.5 analyzed with our classification
- ‚ùå **Implementation artifacts**: Geometric projections use ad-hoc adjacency matrices
- ‚ùå **Circular reasoning risk**: We might be seeing patterns we're looking for

### Technical Limitations
- ‚ùå **Arbitrary weights**: Affinity calculations use unjustified weight combinations [0.3, 0.4, 0.3]
- ‚ùå **Position encoding**: No solution for non-square geometric position encodings
- ‚ùå **Computational overhead**: Parallel geometric processing may be prohibitively expensive
- ‚ùå **Hardware constraints**: Non-square operations lack optimization

### Methodological Concerns
- ‚ùå **No baseline comparisons**: Haven't shown geometric analysis outperforms simpler methods
- ‚ùå **Lack of ablation studies**: Don't know which components (if any) matter
- ‚ùå **No cross-validation**: Patterns might be specific to our test set

## Implementation Status

```python
# Current implementation is a proof-of-concept
from relativistic_interpretability import GeometricProjection

# WARNING: Experimental API, will change
projector = GeometricProjection(seq_len=512)
attention = model.get_attention_weights()

# These projections use arbitrary adjacency matrices
# Results should not be considered meaningful without validation
projections = projector.project(attention, 'hexagonal')  # Experimental
```

## What We're Testing

### Hypotheses (Unvalidated)
1. Different attention patterns might show affinity for different geometric structures
2. Geometric divergence might correlate with model uncertainty
3. Different tasks might preferentially activate different geometric pathways

### Predictions (To Be Tested)
- Vision models may show different geometric distributions than language models
- Code generation might exhibit different patterns than natural language
- Multimodal fusion layers might show geometric switching

**None of these predictions have been validated.**

## Request for Feedback

We specifically seek input on:

1. **Fundamental flaws**: Are we making incorrect assumptions?
2. **Alternative explanations**: Could simpler explanations account for our observations?
3. **Validation approaches**: How would you test these hypotheses?
4. **Prior work**: Are we unknowingly duplicating existing research?
5. **Mathematical rigor**: Where do our formalizations need strengthening?

## Why Share This Now?

Despite the preliminary nature, we're sharing because:
- Early feedback prevents wasted effort on flawed approaches
- Open science benefits from sharing hypotheses, not just results
- Community input can redirect or refine the research
- Transparency about uncertainty is scientifically valuable

## Contributing

We welcome:
- **Constructive criticism**: Point out flaws and suggest improvements
- **Independent validation**: Try to replicate or refute our observations
- **Alternative frameworks**: Propose different interpretations
- **Null results**: Failed replications are valuable
